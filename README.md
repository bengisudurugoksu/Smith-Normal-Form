# Smith-Normal-Form
This repository implements and compares multiple Smith Normal Form (SNF) algorithms for integer matrices in Julia, including classical EEA-based SNF and modern improvements such as modular, fraction-free, divide-and-conquer, and determinant-based methods, with performance benchmarks and SageMath validation.
